## Minute 0-2: The Hook

### Opening (30 seconds)
```
"Thanks for taking the time, [Name]. Before I show you anything, quick question:

When your front desk is busy with patients and the phone rings, what typically happens?"
```

**Listen.** Let them describe their pain:
- "It goes to voicemail"
- "Someone rushes to grab it"  
- "Patients wait"

### Acknowledge & Bridge (30 seconds)
```
"Exactly what I hear from most practices. The problem is, [X%] of callers who get voicemail 
never call back - they just Google the next dentist who answers.

That's what DentSignal solves. Let me show you exactly how it works - this will take 
about 7 minutes."
```

---

## Minute 2-6: The Demo

### Part 1: The Call Experience (2 minutes)
```
"I'm going to call the demo line right now, and you'll hear exactly what a patient hears 
when they call your office."
```

**Make the call.** Put on speakerphone.

After AI answers:
```
"Notice a few things:
1. Answered in 2 rings - no voicemail
2. Sounds natural, not robotic
3. Immediately asks how it can help

Let me show you what happens when a patient wants to book..."
```

### Part 2: Booking Flow (2 minutes)
**Walk through a booking scenario:**
```
"Watch what happens when I say 'I need to schedule a cleaning...'

See how it:
- Asks for availability preferences
- Confirms the date and time
- Gets their callback number
- Sends a confirmation

This entire interaction creates a record in your dashboard."
```

### Part 3: Dashboard Tour (2 minutes)
**Show the dashboard:**
```
"Here's what you see as the practice owner:

- Every call logged with time, duration, outcome
- Full transcripts you can review
- Appointments auto-synced (if integrated)
- After-hours calls marked separately

You get a morning summary email so you know what happened overnight."
```

## Minute 6-8: Objection Handling

### If They Haven't Asked Yet, Prompt:
```
"What questions do you have so far?"
```

### Common Questions & Responses:

**"What if they need to talk to a real person?"**
```
"Great question. The AI offers warm transfer to your front desk during business hours. 
If everyone's busy, it takes a detailed message and texts your team immediately.

You decide the rules - like 'always transfer emergencies' or 'take messages after 5pm.'"
```

**"What about complex questions?"**
```
"If someone asks something the AI can't answer - like specific treatment costs or 
insurance details - it says 'Let me have someone call you back with that information' 
and flags it as priority.

It handles 80% of calls completely, and routes the 20% that need human touch."
```

**"How long to set up?"**
```
"15 minutes. We configure your business hours, location, services offered, and forward 
your number. No IT team needed.

Most practices are live same day."
```

---

## Minute 8-9: Pricing & Close

### Transition to Pricing
```
"Let me cover pricing real quick - it's simple.

$149/month for unlimited calls. No per-minute charges, no surprise fees.

That's less than 1 new patient per month, and most practices tell us they're 
capturing 5-10 calls that would have gone to voicemail."
```

### The Ask
```
"Here's what I'd suggest:

We offer a 14-day free trial - no credit card, no commitment. You can test it 
with real calls and see the data.

If it works, great. If not, you've lost nothing.

Want me to get that set up for [Clinic Name]?"
```

---

## Minute 9-10: Handle Final Objections

### "I need to think about it"
```
"Totally understand. What specific concerns do you want to think through?

[Listen]

The trial is completely free - you could 'think about it' while also testing 
with real calls. Worst case, you have data to make the decision."
```

### "I need to talk to my partner/office manager"
```
"Makes sense. Would it help if I sent a 2-minute video summary you can share 
with them? 

I can also do a quick 10-minute call with both of you if that's easier."
```

### "We're not ready right now"
```
"No problem. When would be a better time to revisit? I can set a reminder 
and reach back out then.

In the meantime, here's the website: dentsignal.me - feel free to poke around."
```

### "We already use [competitor]"
```
"Got it. What made you choose them?

[Listen]

How's it been working? Any gaps or things you wish were different?

[If yes, address how DentSignal solves those gaps]
[If no, respect their choice and offer to reconnect in 6 months]"
```

## Demo Tips

1. **Ask more than you tell** - Every question gets them more invested
2. **Use their practice name** - "When a patient calls [Clinic Name]..."
3. **Watch for "tell me more" signals** - Leaning in, nodding, taking notes
4. **If they check their phone, you've lost them** - Re-engage with a question
5. **End with a clear next step** - Never end with "let me know what you think"
