## Email Sequence (3-Email Cadence)

### Email 1: The Problem Email
**Subject Lines (test these):**
- "40% of your calls may be going to voicemail"
- "[First Name], what happens when no one can answer?"
- "Your front desk called - they need backup"

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

Quick question: when a patient calls [Clinic Name] and your team is busy with patients, what happens?

If it's voicemail, you're not alone. The average dental practice sends 40% of calls to voicemail, and 1 in 4 of those callers never call back.

That's potentially 5-10 lost new patients every month at $300+ each.

We built DentSignal to solve this - an AI receptionist that answers every call, books appointments, and sounds like your best front desk person.

Worth a quick 10-minute demo?

P.S. We offer a 14-day free trial, no credit card required.

### Email 2: The Social Proof Email (Send day 3)
**Subject:** "Re: Quick follow-up"

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

Following up on my last email. Wanted to share what we're seeing with practices using DentSignal:

• 35% reduction in missed calls
• 15-25% more booked appointments from calls that would have gone to voicemail
• Front desk staff can focus on in-person patients

Here's a 2-minute video of the AI in action: [VIDEO_LINK]

If missed calls aren't a problem for you, happy to leave you alone! But if they are, a 10-minute demo could be worth $1000+ in recovered appointments this month.

Let me know either way?

[Your Name]

### Email 3: The Breakup Email (Send day 7)
**Subject:** "Closing the loop"

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

Last email from me, I promise.

I've reached out a couple times about helping [Clinic Name] capture more patient calls. I know you're busy running a practice.

Three scenarios:

1. **Not interested** - No worries, I'll stop emailing
2. **Interested but bad timing** - Just reply "later" and I'll check back in 3 months
3. **Ready to see a demo** - Reply "yes" and I'll send calendar link

Here if you ever need us: dentsignal.me

Best,
[Your Name]

### For After-Hours Focus
**Subject:** "Who answers [Clinic Name]'s phone at 7pm?"

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

When patients call your office after hours, what happens?

If they hear voicemail and a promise to call back tomorrow, some of them won't wait. They'll Google the next dentist who answers.

DentSignal answers 24/7:
- Takes messages properly
- Books appointments if you allow
- Handles emergencies with the right urgency
- Sends you a summary every morning

Costs less than 1 missed new patient per month.

10-minute demo to see if it fits?

### For Busy Practices
**Subject:** "Your front desk is great (but they can't clone themselves)"

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

I'm guessing your front desk team at [Clinic Name] is excellent. The problem is, they're also:

- Checking in patients
- Handling insurance questions
- Processing payments
- AND answering phones

When call #3 comes in while they're with a patient, something gives.

DentSignal acts as a backup receptionist that handles calls when your team is busy. No hiring, no overtime, no missed calls.

$149/mo, unlimited calls. 14-day trial.

Worth a look?

[Your Name]
```

### For New Practices (0-2 years old)
**Subject:** "Growing [Clinic Name]? Don't let calls go to waste"

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

Congratulations on [Clinic Name] - building a practice from scratch is no joke.

When you're spending money on marketing to drive new patients, the last thing you want is for those calls to go to voicemail.

DentSignal ensures every call gets answered, every patient gets scheduled, every emergency gets triaged properly.

For $149/mo, you never miss a call again.

I know every dollar matters in a new practice. Happy to do a free 14-day trial so you can see the ROI first.

Quick demo?
