# Objection Handling Guide

Quick reference for the most common objections and how to handle them.

---

## Price Objections

### "It's too expensive"
**Response:**
```
"I hear you. Let me ask - how much is a new patient worth to your practice?"

[They answer: usually $300-500+]

"Right. So if DentSignal captures just 1-2 calls per month that would have 
gone to voicemail, it's already paid for itself.

Most practices tell us they're capturing 5-10 extra appointments monthly. 
That's $1,500-5,000 in value for $149.

Does that math work for your practice?"
```

### "We can't afford it right now"
**Response:**
```
"I understand cash flow is important. Here's a thought:

The 14-day trial is completely free. You can see exactly how many calls 
we capture before spending anything.

If the data shows positive ROI, you're making money. If not, you've 
lost nothing. Fair?"
```

### "That's more than we pay now"
**Response:**
```
"What are you using currently?"

[Listen]

"Got it. How's it been working?"

[If there are gaps, address them]

"The difference with DentSignal is [specific differentiator]. For many 
practices, that's worth the extra $X/month because [specific benefit]."
```

## Trust / Credibility Objections

### "Never heard of you"
**Response:**
```
"That's fair - we're newer to the market. That actually works in your favor:

1. We're priced aggressively to build our customer base
2. Every customer gets direct support (no ticket queues)
3. We're constantly improving based on feedback

The 14-day trial lets you validate everything before committing anything."
```

### "How do I know it works?"
**Response:**
```
"Great question. Here are a few ways:

1. Live demo - you can call the line right now and hear it
2. Trial period - test with your real patients for 14 days
3. Dashboard - you'll see every call logged with transcripts

Would a quick demo right now help you feel more confident?"
```

### "AI isn't good enough yet"
**Response:**
```
"I get that skepticism - a lot of early AI was rough. Have you tried 
any AI phone systems recently?

The tech has improved dramatically. This isn't the robotic IVR from 
10 years ago.

Best way to see it: call the demo line. If it doesn't impress you, 
you have your answer. If it does, we can talk about next steps."
```

## Timing Objections

### "We're too busy right now"
**Response:**
```
"I hear you - and that's actually the perfect reason to do this.

If you're busy, your front desk is probably slammed. That means calls 
are getting missed or rushed.

DentSignal runs in the background - setup takes 15 minutes, then 
it just works. You don't have to manage it.

Could we get it set up now so it's working before your next busy week?"
```

### "Call me back in [3 months / next year]"
**Response:**
```
"Happy to do that. Before I go - what changes in [3 months / next year] 
that makes it a better time?"

[Listen for the real objection]

"Got it. [Address the real concern]

If the timing still doesn't work, I'll set a reminder. But if it's 
just hesitation, the trial is free and you could be capturing more 
appointments starting this week."
```

### "We're in the middle of [X project]"
**Response:**
```
"Understood. Is the project related to phones or front desk?

[If yes] "Great - DentSignal might actually help with that. Want 
to explore how it fits?"

[If no] "Got it. DentSignal is pretty hands-off once set up - runs 
in the background. Would adding it now actually add to your plate, 
or would it just work alongside [project]?"
```

## Competitive Objections

### "We already use [competitor]"
**Response:**
```
"Nice - how's it been working for you?"

[Listen carefully]

"What made you choose them?"

[Listen]

"If I could show you how DentSignal is [better/different in X way], 
would that be worth 10 minutes of your time?"
```

### "We're talking to other vendors"
**Response:**
```
"Smart to compare. What are you looking for in a solution?"

[Listen]

"Those are important. Here's how DentSignal stacks up:
[Address their specific criteria]

Happy to do a side-by-side comparison if that would help your decision."
```

### "We tried AI before and it didn't work"
**Response:**
```
"What happened?"

[Listen - usually it's bad UX, inaccuracy, or poor integration]

"That's frustrating. What you experienced sounds like [diagnose].

DentSignal was built dental-first, so [specific differentiator that 
addresses their past problem].

I get the hesitation. Would a 14-day trial help you validate without 
committing?"
```

## Decision-Maker Objections

### "I need to talk to my partner/office manager"
**Response:**
```
"Totally understand. A few options:

1. I can send a 2-minute video summary you can forward
2. I can hop on a quick call with both of you
3. You could start the free trial and show them the results

What works best?"
```

### "My office manager handles this"
**Response:**
```
"Got it. Would you be able to loop them in, or should I reach out 
directly?

If you give me their email or number, I can take it from here and 
not bother you with it."
```

### "I don't make technology decisions"
**Response:**
```
"Understood. Who would be the right person to talk to?

And is there anything I can send you to share with them? Sometimes 
a quick intro from you helps open the door."
```

## Technical Objections

### "Does it integrate with [PMS/EHR]?"
**Response:**
```
"Which system are you using?"

[Listen]

"We integrate with [common systems]. For [their system], we [have 
integration / are building it / have workaround].

Even without direct integration, we can [email/SMS appointments, 
sync via CSV, etc.]. Would that work for your workflow?"
```

### "What if it makes mistakes?"
**Response:**
```
"Great question. A few safeguards:

1. Every call is transcribed - you can review any conversation
2. Complex requests get flagged for human follow-up
3. You set the rules - like 'always transfer to front desk for 
   insurance questions'

It's not about replacing your team - it's about handling the calls 
they can't get to."
```

### "What about HIPAA?"
**Response:**
```
"Critical question. We're built for healthcare:

- All data encrypted in transit and at rest
- No patient data stored longer than necessary
- BAA available for covered entities
- We don't train our models on your data

Want me to send over our compliance documentation?"
```

## The Last Resort (When Nothing Works)

### "I'm just not interested"
**Response:**
```
"Appreciate you being direct. Before I go - was it the solution itself, 
the timing, or something else?

[Listen]

"Got it. If anything changes, you know where to find us. 

Take care, and best of luck with [Clinic Name]."
```

## General Principles

1. **Always diagnose first** - "Help me understand..." or "What's behind that concern?"
2. **Agree before pivoting** - "That makes sense. Here's another way to look at it..."
3. **Use their words** - Repeat their exact phrases back to them
4. **Small commitment first** - Trial, demo, or calendar invite
5. **Know when to stop** - If they're done, respect it and leave the door open
