## Follow-Up Messages (After Connection)

### Day 2-3 Follow-Up: The Soft Ask
```
Thanks for connecting, [First Name]!

Quick question - when a patient calls your office and no one can answer, what happens to that call?

If it goes to voicemail, you might be losing 20-30% of those callers (they just call the next dentist).

We've built an AI receptionist that answers every call, books appointments, and sounds natural. 

Worth a 10-minute demo to see if it fits?
```

### Day 5-7 Follow-Up: The Pain Point
```
Hey [First Name],

Not sure if this resonates, but most practice owners I talk to mention two things:

1. Front desk is slammed → calls get missed
2. After-hours calls → straight to voicemail → lost patients

We solve both for $149/mo. No contracts, 14-day trial.

Interested in seeing how it works?
```

### Day 10 Follow-Up: The Breakup
```
Hi [First Name],

Last message from me - I know you're busy!

If missed calls or after-hours coverage ever becomes a priority, DentSignal handles unlimited inbound calls + books appointments automatically.

Here when you're ready: dentsignal.me

Best of luck with the practice!

## Conversation Scripts

### When They Say "Tell Me More"
```
Happy to share!

DentSignal is an AI phone receptionist built specifically for dental offices. When a patient calls:

✓ AI answers in 3 rings (no voicemail)
✓ Understands dental terminology 
✓ Books/confirms appointments
✓ Handles emergencies properly
✓ Works 24/7

Most practices see 15-25% more appointments from calls that would have gone to voicemail.

Want me to send a quick demo video, or would a 10-min live call work better?
```

### When They Say "How Much?"
```
Starts at $149/mo for unlimited calls. No per-minute charges, no long-term contracts.

Most practices break even with just 1-2 extra appointments per month (that would have been voicemails).

Want to see it in action first? I can do a quick 10-min demo.
```

### When They Ask About Competition
```
Great question! The main differences vs. [competitor]:

DentSignal:
✓ Dental-specific from day one (not generic)
✓ No per-minute pricing (unlimited calls)
✓ 14-day free trial, no credit card
✓ Setup in 15 minutes

Happy to show you a side-by-side if you're comparing.
