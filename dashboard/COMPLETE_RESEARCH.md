# 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

## The Market Opportunity (One Paragraph)

Dental practices lose **$255,000 per year** to missed calls (300/month × $850 value per missed call). They hire full-time receptionists at **$60-80k loaded cost** just to answer phones. AI voice agents cost **$50-100/month to operate** but can answer all calls 24/7. This creates a **12,000%+ ROI** for practices. The market is **completely underpriced** – competitors charge $250-400/month when cost is $50-100/month. **Your positioning:** 3-4x cheaper entry point for small practices ($1-3M revenue) that can't afford $400/month Weave.

## Target Market Decision

| Priority | Target | Why |
|----------|--------|-----|
| 🥇 **MVP** | 1-2 dentist practices | 130k practices, underserved, fastest sales cycle |
| 🥈 **Phase 2** | 3-4 dentist practices | Higher ROI, expand after 50+ customers |
| 🥉 **Later** | 5+ dentist (DSOs) | Complex sales, Weave dominates |

## Critical Numbers

| Metric | Value | Use |
|--------|-------|-----|
| Annual loss to missed calls | **$255,000** | Headline grabber |
| Missed calls/month (avg) | **300** | Show the problem |
| Receptionist cost (loaded) | **$65,000/year** | Compare to AI |
| AI operating cost | **$50-100/month** | Your COGS |
| AI price point | **$99-149/month** | Undercut competitors 3-4x |
| ROI for customer | **12,000%+** | Why they buy |
| Payback period | **< 1 day** | Key selling point |

# 2. MARKET OPPORTUNITY

## Why This Matters

- **200,000+** dental practices in US
- **$255k** average annual lost revenue per practice
- **$51B TAM** (total addressable market)
- **100,000** small practices (your target) × $100/month = **$120M/year potential**

## Market Adoption Status (Dec 2025)

- **15-20%** of dental practices have AI receptionist currently
- **65%** expected to adopt by end of 2026
- Pain point is universal: **Every practice loses calls**

## Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Price | Gap for You |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| Weave | $249-400/month | Too expensive for small practices |
| RevenueWell | $175/month | No inbound call handling |
| Dentrix | $200-500/month | Locked to their PMS |
| **Your Solution** | $99-149/month | 3-4x cheaper, focused |

|-------|----------|----------|
| Phase 1 | Web-form based (no PMS) | MVP |
| Phase 2 | DentalBridge API (top 3 PMS) | Month 3-6 |
| Phase 3 | Real-time two-way sync | Month 6-12 |

## Market Gap = Your Opportunity

Current problems:
- ❌ No real-time inbound call handling with PMS
- ❌ Calls go to voicemail, manually entered later
- ❌ Weave/RevenueWell don't sync appointments properly
- ❌ After-hours = 100% missed (no integration)

# 15. APPOINTMENT TYPES & SCHEDULING RULES
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Research Date:** December 2025

## Standard Appointment Durations

| Procedure | Duration | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Routine Exam + Cleaning | 30-60 min | Typically 45 min |
| Simple Filling (1 surface) | 20-30 min | Quick, back-to-back OK |
| Complex Filling (2+ surfaces) | 30-60 min | Varies |
| Crown Prep (first visit) | 60-90 min | Complex |
| Crown Delivery (second) | 30-60 min | Shorter |
| Root Canal | 60-120 min | 1-3 sessions |
| Extraction (simple) | 20-40 min | Per tooth |
| Extraction (surgical) | 45-120 min | Wisdom teeth |
| Teeth Whitening | 60-90 min | In-office |
| Implant Placement | 60-120 min | Surgical |
| Periodontal scaling | 30-60 min | Per quadrant |
| **Emergency** | 30-45 min | Priority slot |

## Key Scheduling Rules

### AI MUST Follow These:
- **New patient cleaning:** Book **60 minutes** (extra paperwork)
- **Existing patient cleaning:** Book **45 minutes**
- **Emergency:** Ask pain level + when it started

### Hard Constraints (CANNOT book)
- ❌ 2 extractions back-to-back (bleeding risk)
- ❌ Surgical extraction in final slot (recovery needed)
- ❌ Root canal at end of day (runs over)
- ❌ New patient during lunch (paperwork backlog)

### Soft Constraints (Avoid if possible)
- ⚠️ Cosmetic first thing AM
- ⚠️ 3+ fillings in a row
- ⚠️ New patient without 15 min buffer

## Booking Windows
- **Emergency:** Same-day or next-day only
- **Regular:** 2-4 weeks out
- **New patient:** 1-2 weeks out (high cancel risk)

## Emergency Triage Questions (In Order)

```
1. "Where is the pain?" (tooth location)
2. "On a scale 1-10, how bad?" (8+ = urgent)
3. "How long has it been hurting?" (hours vs days)
4. "Can you bite down?" (mobility = urgent)
5. "Any swelling in face/jaw?" (infection = urgent)
```

### Emergency Handling Rules
| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Pain 8-10 | Same-day (drop everything) |
| Swelling/fever | Same-day or ER |
| Trauma (broken tooth) | Same-day priority |
| Post-op complications | Contact dentist directly |

## New Patient vs Existing Patient

### New Patient Workflow
1. Verify insurance (if asked)
2. Collect: name, phone, email
3. Ask: "Do you have dental anxiety?"
4. Ask: "What brings you in today?"
5. Book **60-minute** appointment
6. Send consent forms via email BEFORE visit

### Existing Patient Workflow
1. Name/DOB lookup
2. Ask: "What brings you in?"
3. Book based on appointment type
4. Skip paperwork

**Key for AI:** `IF new_patient THEN ask_more_questions`

# 16. COMMON PATIENT QUESTIONS & OBJECTIONS
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Research Date:** December 2025

## Top 20 Patient Questions

### Insurance & Cost (Most Common)

**Q1: "Do you accept my insurance?"** ← MOST COMMON
- Ask: "What's your insurance carrier?"
- Check system → "Yes, we're in-network" or "We can file your claim"
- **AI needs:** Insurance lookup function

**Q2: "What's the cost of [procedure]?"**
- Answer: "Typically $[range]. Recommend a consult for exact pricing"
- Counter: "We offer payment plans" / "Insurance covers 50-100%"

**Q3: "Do you take Medicaid/Medicare?"**
- Varies by practice - store as practice profile

**Q4: "Will my insurance cover this?"**
- Answer: "Let me verify. What's your plan?"
- **Never guess** (legal liability)

**Q5: "What if I don't have insurance?"**
- Answer: "We offer cash discounts" or "Payment plans available"

### Appointment Logistics

**Q6: "How long does the appointment take?"**
- "30-45 min for cleaning, 60+ for fillings"

**Q7: "Can I bring my kids?"**
- Varies by practice - store as policy

**Q8: "What time slots do you have?"**
- **THIS IS YOUR AI's MAIN JOB**
- Offer 3-5 specific options with dates/times

**Q9: "Can I reschedule if running late?"**
- "Yes, call if >10 min late"

**Q10: "Do I need to fast?"**
- "No, unless having sedation"

### Procedure Questions

**Q11: "Does it hurt?"**
- "No, we use local anesthesia. Pressure but no pain"

**Q12: "How many visits will I need?"**
- "Crown = 2 visits, implant = 3-6 months total"

**Q13: "Can you whiten my teeth?"**
- Check if practice offers it

**Q14: "Is my cavity urgent?"**
- "If painless, 1-2 weeks OK. If sensitive, sooner"

**Q15: "Do you do root canals?"**
- "Simple ones yes. Complex ones we refer to specialists"

## Objection Handling (Top 10)

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **"Too expensive"** | "We offer payment plans. Delaying costs more." |
| **"Don't have time"** | "How about [off-peak time]? Just trying to get you on the books" |
| **"I'll call back"** | "Absolutely. Is [phone] the best number?" → GET CALLBACK # |
| **"Let me ask my partner"** | "Of course! I'll send info via email" → GET EMAIL |
| **"Shopping around"** | "We're happy to provide a quote. Feel free to compare" |
| **"Bad experience elsewhere"** | "I'm sorry. We focus on comfort. Give us a chance?" |
| **"Too busy this week"** | "How about [specific day next week]?" → LOCK DATE |
| **"Email me a quote"** | "Happy to. But recommend 10-min consultation for accuracy" |
| **"Don't know if I'll like you"** | "First visit is low commitment. If you don't like us, no problem" |
| **"Scared of dentist"** | "Many patients say that. We go slowly. Can use sedation" |

## AI Script Framework

```
1. Greeting: "Hi! Thanks for calling [practice]. How can I help?"
2. Identify: "Have you been to us before?" [new vs existing]
3. Qualify: "What brings you in today?" [procedure type]
4. Assess: "How urgent is this?" [triage]
5. Verify: "Do you have insurance with us?" [coverage]
6. Offer: "I have [3 specific times]. What works best?"
7. Confirm: [name, phone, email, new patient forms]
8. Follow-up: "We'll send confirmation + directions"
```

## Critical Rules for AI

✅ **MUST ask insurance upfront**
✅ **MUST get callback number** if "call back later"
✅ **MUST identify procedure type** for appointment length
✅ **MUST identify pain level** for emergencies
✅ **MUST empathize before countering** objections
✅ **MUST offer 3-5 specific time slots** (not "when works for you?")
✅ **SHOULD ask "are you a new patient?"** at start

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Research Date:** December 2025

## Weave (Market Leader)

### Pricing
- Base: **$249-400/month**
- Setup: $500-2,000
- Contract: **12-month minimum**

### What Customers Like
- ✅ Integrated texting + voice
- ✅ Call recording
- ✅ 100+ PMS integrations
- ✅ Reduces no-shows 5-10%

### What Customers HATE (Real Reviews)
- ❌ **Customer support is awful** (76% negative)
  - 2+ hours on hold
  - 3+ examples required before help
  - No escalation path
- ❌ **Sync issues with PMS** (constant problems)
  - Wrong texts sent to patients
  - Schedule mismatches
  - Takes 2+ weeks to fix
- ❌ **Over-engineered** (features you don't need)
  - Hardware phone markup
  - Hard to cancel
  - Hidden costs
- ❌ **Limited AI for inbound calls**
  - Mostly OUTBOUND (reminders)
  - INBOUND needs human fallback
- ❌ **Pricing creep**

**Critical weakness:** Weave is good at reminders but **terrible at answering inbound calls**. This is YOUR entry point.

## RevenueWell

### Positioning
Patient communication + no-show reduction (NOT call answering)

### Pricing: $175-200/month

### Does:
- ✅ Automated reminders
- ✅ Review requests
- ✅ Recall campaigns

### Does NOT:
- ❌ Answer inbound calls
- ❌ Handle voice booking
- ❌ Provide AI receptionist

**Your advantage:** They don't touch inbound calls at all.

## Dentrix

### Pricing: $200-500/month + $5k-20k implementation

### Reality:
- ❌ Not designed for inbound call handling
- ❌ AI feels bolted-on
- ❌ Proprietary lock-in
- ❌ 3-6 month implementation

**Your advantage:** 10x cheaper, focused, no lock-in.

## Annie AI (Bundled into Weave)
- Not standalone anymore
- Limited independent reviews

## Your Competitive Position

| Factor | Weave | RevenueWell | Dentrix | **YOU** |
|--------|-------|-------------|---------|---------|
| Price | $250-400 | $175-200 | $200-500 | **$99-149** |
| Inbound Calls | Moderate | NONE | Minimal | **Excellent** |
| AI Quality | Basic | N/A | Basic | **Good** |
| PMS Agnostic | Yes | Yes | No | **Yes** |
| Contract | 12 months | Monthly | Annual | **Monthly** |

**Key differentiation:**
1. **3-4x cheaper** than Weave
2. **Focused on inbound** (they do reminders)
3. **AI-first** (not bolted-on)
4. **No lock-in** (month-to-month)

## Messaging That Works

✅ **"AI receptionist for less than coffee budget"**
✅ **"Works with Dentrix, Open Dental, Eaglesoft"**
✅ **"Answers calls 24/7 (weekends too)"**
✅ **"No long-term contract"**

❌ "AI is the future" (too vague)
❌ "Enterprise-grade" (sounds expensive)
❌ "Powered by GPT-4" (they don't care)

## Recommended Positioning

**Headline:** "Never Miss Another $8,000 Patient Again"

**Subheader:** "AI receptionist answers all your calls 24/7. Handles booking, scheduling, and insurance questions. No technical setup required."
