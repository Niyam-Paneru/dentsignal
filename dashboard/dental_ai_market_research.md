## 5. PHONE INQUIRY → REVENUE CONVERSION ECONOMICS

### Single New Patient Inquiry Conversion Path

**Scenario: Typical inquiry "I'm looking for a dentist for a cleaning"**

| Metric | Top 25% | Average | Bottom 25% |
|--------|---------|---------|------------|
| Call answered | 85%+ | 65% | 40% |
| Answer → books appt | 85% | 53% | 25% |
| Books appt but shows up | 90% | 78% | 60% |
| **Effective conversion** | **65%** | **27%** | **6%** |
| Initial appointment value | $200 | $200 | $200 |
| First visit revenue | **$130** | **$54** | **$12** |
| Assume 60% become regular patients | 39% | 16% | 4% |
| Lifetime patient value (assume 8-year relationship) | **$7,800** | **$3,120** | **$780** |

**Key finding:** Each *answered* call has $3,120-$7,800 lifetime value; each *missed* call loses that entirely.

### After-Hours Call Premium
- **Response to after-hours call:** 10x more likely to book than voicemail
- **Average after-hours conversion:** 60% → booked appointment
- **Same-day or next-day urgency:** Often fills gaps in schedule

## 8. KEY ROI METRICS DENTAL PRACTICES CARE ABOUT

### Primary Metrics (What They Measure)

**1. Missed Call Recovery**
- *Metric:* # of calls answered that would have gone to voicemail
- *Calculation:* (Calls answered by AI / Total calls) × Missed call $$
- *Example:* 100 extra calls answered × $850 value = $85,000 recovered per year
- *Decision threshold:* Practices want payback in <6 months

**2. Appointment Booking Rate**
- *Metric:* % of calls that result in scheduled appointment
- *Calculation:* (Calls → Bookings) / Total calls × Average appointment value
- *Example:* 40% conversion × 1,000 calls/month × $400 = $160,000 annual revenue impact
- *Decision threshold:* Must show 30%+ improvement over existing (50% → 65%+ with AI)

**3. Revenue Per Call**
- *Metric:* Average revenue attributed per inbound call
- *Current state:* $50-150/call (assuming 28% effective conversion rate)
- *With AI:* $200-300/call (60%+ conversion rate × appointment value)
- *Payback calculation:* $(additional revenue per call - AI cost per call) × calls/month

**4. No-Show Reduction**
- *Metric:* % reduction in appointment cancellations/no-shows
- *Current:* 15-25% no-show rate (lost $60-$100 per missed appointment)
- *With AI confirmation texts:* 5-10% reduction possible
- *Value:* 20 calls/month × $400 × 10% = $800/month recovered

**5. After-Hours Call Capture**
- *Metric:* Revenue from calls answered outside 9-5
- *Current:* Zero (goes to voicemail, rarely books)
- *With AI:* 50-60% of after-hours calls → appointments
- *Example:* 150 after-hours calls/month × 55% conversion × $400 = $33,000/year additional

### Secondary Metrics (Nice-to-Have)

**Staff Time Freed Up:**
- Receptionist time saved on mundane scheduling: 2-4 hours/day
- Value: $30-40/hour × 3 hours = $90-120/day = $22,000/year
- Reallocation: Higher-value patient experience tasks

**Patient Satisfaction:**
- 60% of patients prefer instant appointment booking over call wait
- NPS improvement: +5-10 points (tracks brand preference)
- Retention impact: 1-2% higher retention = $10,000-30,000/year

**Insurance Verification:**
- Real-time eligibility check saves patient follow-ups
- Reduces claim denials by 2-3%
- Value: $200-500/month depending on claim volume

## Usage Recommendations for ROI Calculator

1. **Conservative scenario:** Use 40% conversion rate, 30% missed call reduction
2. **Base case:** Use 50% conversion rate, 50% missed call recovery
3. **Optimistic:** Use 60% conversion rate, 80% missed call recovery

Use regional salary data to show practice owner what they'd pay for 1 FTE receptionist as anchor comparison ($60-80k loaded cost).

Emphasize **after-hours call capture** ($20-40k/year additional) as differentiator from human receptionists.
