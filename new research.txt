### The Math
Your practice likely misses 10+ calls per day. At $400 per appointment, that's $8,000-12,000/month in lost revenue.
DentSignal costs $199/month and captures 95%+ of those calls.
ROI: Pays for itself after recovering just 1 missed call.

### Founding Customer Guarantee
Lock in $199/month forever. Price may increase for new customers after we reach 50 practices.

### What Sets Us Apart
✓ Unlimited calls (no caps, no overages)
✓ No setup fees (others charge $500-2,000)
✓ Month-to-month (no 12+ month lock-in)
✓ 48-hour setup (not weeks or months)
✓ Direct founder support (4h response time)
✓ Works out of the box (no complex integrations)
